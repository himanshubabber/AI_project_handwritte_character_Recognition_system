# AI_project_handwritte_character_Recognition_system

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten English alphabets (A–Z) using the A–Z Handwritten Characters dataset. The model is trained on preprocessed grayscale images and achieves high accuracy in recognizing characters. It leverages deep learning techniques such as convolutional layers, ReLU activation, max pooling, and softmax classification for effective feature learning and prediction.
